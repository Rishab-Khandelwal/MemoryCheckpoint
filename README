Contents of the submission:
	-README
	-myckpt.h
	-myckpt.c
	-hello.c
	-Makefile
	-restart.c
	-restart.h


Running/testing the code:
	- Do a make check or alternatively do the following : 
	- Start the target program (i.e. 'hello')
		./hello
	- Send SIGUSR2 signal to terminate the target program, this will triger the creation of checkpoint image (resides at './myckpt') for later use
		kill -12 `pgrep -n hello`
	- Resume the target program using the checkpoint image created on previous step
		./restart myckpt

Automation with Makefile:
	- to clean the environment
		make clean
	- to clean, build and test the code
		make [check]

Make build compiles the process file
